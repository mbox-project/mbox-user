              Could you explain the concept of Escrow?
            </span>
            An escrow is a legal agreement between multiple parties that
            establishes the specific terms and conditions for holding an asset
            with a third party until particular requirements are fulfilled.

              Release Deal Requirements
            </span>
            Marketbox will disburse the locked Deposit to the Seller once
            specific requirements are fulfilled, essentially, once all release
            conditions are met, we will deposit the invoice deposit to the
            seller or vendor/merchant.
          </p>

          <p>
            Criterion for the release of payments (invoice) are listed below:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-inside list-[upper-alpha] space-y-4">
            <li className="">
              the buyer has received the items listed on an invoice created by a
              vendor and is fully satisfied with their condition. As a result,
              the buyer clicks on our platform's buttons to authorize payment
              release to the seller. This action cannot be undone once
              completed.
            </li>
            <li className="">
              the Vendor on our platform created an invoice for the items
              ordered and paid by Buyer, which particular order the
              vendor/merchant/seller has full filled.
            </li>
            <li className="">
              by paying an invoice, a buyer already accepted the value and items
              on the invoice and it will be treated a correct version of order
              manifest.
            </li>
            <li className="">
              We advise that before vendor cancels a deal (seller), it is the
              responsibility of the seller to ensure the retrieval of items from
              the buyer.
